Hi, I’m John, musician but currently studying Full Stack Web Developement Diploma at Code Institute through which I plan to find work in the near future.

I will gradually fill my Github with my work, and I would love some constructive feedback if you are here and feel the urge.

You can reach me by emailing contact@johnvenkiah.com.

All the best!


/John
